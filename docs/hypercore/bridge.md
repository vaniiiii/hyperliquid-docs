# Bridge

Deposits to the bridge are signed by the validators and are credited when more than 2/3 of the staking power has signed the deposit.

Withdrawals from Hyperliquid are immediately deducted from the L1 balance, and validators sign the withdrawal as separate transactions. When 2/3 of the staking power has signed the withdrawal, an EVM transaction can be sent to the bridge to request the withdrawal.&#x20;

After a withdrawal is requested, there is a dispute period during which the bridge can be locked for a malicious withdrawal that does not match the Hyperliquid state. Cold wallet signatures of 2/3 of the stake-weighted validator set are required to unlock the bridge. &#x20;

After the dispute period, finalization transactions are sent, which distribute the USDC to the corresponding destination addresses. There is a similar mechanism to maintain the set of active validators and their corresponding stake on the bridge contract.&#x20;

Withdrawals do not require any Arbitrum ETH from the user. Instead, a withdrawal gas fee of 1 USDC is paid by the user on Hyperliquid to cover the Arbitrum gas costs of the validators. &#x20;

The bridge and its logic in relation to the L1 staking have been audited by Zellic. See the Hyperliquid Github repository for the full bridge code, and the [Audits](/hyperliquid-docs/audits.md) section for the audit reports.
