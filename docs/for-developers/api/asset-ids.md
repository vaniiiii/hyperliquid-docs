# Asset IDs

Asset IDs are the integer representation for sending orders and cancels via actions. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/exchange-endpoint.md) for more details.

### Perps

Perpetual endpoints expect an integer for `asset`, which is the index of the coin found in the `meta` info response. E.g. `BTC = 0` on mainnet.

Builder-deployed perps expect `100000 + perp_dex_index * 10000 + index_in_meta` . For example, `test:ABC` on testnet has `perp_dex_index = 1` ,`index_in_meta = 0` , `asset = 110000` . Note that builder-deployed perps always have name in the format `{dex}:{coin}` .

### Spot

Spot endpoints expect `10000 + spotInfo["index"]` where `spotInfo` is the corresponding object in `spotMeta` that has the desired quote and base tokens. For example, when submitting an order for `PURR/USDC`, the asset that should be used is `10000` because its asset index in the spot info is `0`.

Note that spot ID is different from token ID, and that mainnet and testnet have different asset IDs. For example, for HYPE:

Mainnet token ID: 150

Mainnet spot ID: 107

Testnet token ID: 1105

Testnet spot ID: 1035

### Outcomes

Outcomes share most implementation details with spot trading, with a different token representing each outcome side. However, the API representation of outcomes is different from both spot and perps.

Outcome assets are derived from an `outcome` id plus a binary `side`. These are found in the `outcomeMeta` info response.

For an outcome with id `outcome` and side `side`:

```
encoding = 10 * outcome + side
```

Only side `0` and side `1` are valid.

Example:

* outcome `1`, side `0` -> encoding `10`

The same `encoding` is used in three different representations:

* Outcome spot coin: `#<encoding>`
* Outcome token name: `+<encoding>`
* Outcome asset ID: `100_000_000 + encoding`

Example:

* `#10` = outcome `1`, side `0`
* `+10` = the corresponding token name
* `100000010` = asset ID
