# HIP-3 deployer actions

The API for deploying and operating builder-deployed perpetual dexs involves the following L1 action:

```typescript
// IMPORTANT: All lists of tuples should be lexographically sorted before signing
type PerpDeployAction =
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      registerAsset2: RegisterAsset2,
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      registerAsset: RegisterAsset,
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setOracle: SetOracle,
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setFundingMultipliers: SetFundingMultipliers,
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setFundingInterestRates: SetFundingInterestRates,
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      haltTrading: { coin: string, isHalted: boolean },
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setMarginTableIds: SetMarginTableIds,

 * RegisterAsset2 can be called to initialize a new dex and register an asset at the same time.

 * for the provided dex.
 * @param maxGas - Max gas in native token wei. If not provided, then uses current deploy auction price.
 * If the max gas is 0, then a reserve deployment will be used. 
 * A reserve deployment allows deployment at the current price of the gas auction, even if it has ended. 
 * Currently, 7 reserve deployments are allowed. 
 * IMPORTANT: A reserve deployment will be used regardless of whether the auction has completed, so deployers should query the auction status first.
 * @param assetRequest - Contains new asset listing parameters. See RegisterAssetRequest2 below for details.
 * @param dex - Name of the perp dex (2-4 characters)
 * @param schema - Contains new perp dex parameters. See PerpDexSchemaInput below for details.

 *
 * Stale mark prices will be updated to the local mark price after 10 seconds of no updates.
 * This fallback counts as an update for purposes of the maximal update frequency.
 * This fallback behavior should not be relied upon. Deployers are expected to call setOracle every 3 seconds even with no changes.
 *
 * All prices are clamped to 10x the start of day value.
 * markPx moves are clamped to 1% from previous markPx.
 * markPx cannot be updated such that open interest would be 10x the open interest cap.

 * @param oraclePxs - A list (sorted by key) of asset and oracle prices.
 * @param markPxs - An outer list of inner lists (inner list sorted by key) of asset and mark prices.
 * @param externalPerpPxs - A list (sorted by key) of asset and external prices which prevent sudden mark price deviations. 
                            Ideally externally determined by deployer, but could fall back to an EMA of recent mark prices.

### Open interest caps <a href="#open-interest-caps" id="open-interest-caps"></a>

Builder-deployed perp markets are subject to two types of open interest caps: notional (sum of absolute position size times mark price) and size (sum of absolute position sizes).

Notional open interest caps are enforced on the total open interest summed over all assets within the DEX, as well as per-asset. Perp deployers can set a custom open interest cap per asset, which is documented in <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/hip-3-deployer-actions>.

Size-denominated open interest caps are only enforced per-asset. Size-denominated open interest caps are currently a constant 1B per asset, so a reasonable default would be to set `szDecimals` such that the minimal size increment is $1-10 at the initial mark price.
