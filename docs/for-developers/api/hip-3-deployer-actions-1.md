# HIP-3 deployer actions

The API for deploying and operating builder-deployed perpetual dexs involves the following L1 action:

```typescript
type PerpDeployAction =
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      registerAsset: RegisterAsset,
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setOracle: SetOracle,
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setFundingMultipliers: SetFundingMultipliers,
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      haltTrading: { coin: string, isHalted: boolean },
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setMarginTableIds: SetMarginTableIds,
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setFeeRecipient: { dex: string, feeRecipient: address },
    }  
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setOpenInterestCaps: SetOpenInterestCaps
    }
  | {
      type: "perpDeploy",
      setSubDeployers: { dex: string, subDeployers: Array<SubDeployerInput> }
    };

 *
 * Stale mark prices will be updated to the local mark price after 10 seconds of no updates.
 * This fallback counts as an update for purposes of the maximal update frequency.
 * This fallback behavior should not be relied upon. Deployers are expected to call setOracle every 3 seconds even with no changes.
 *
 * All prices are clamped to 10x the start of day value.
 * markPx moves are clamped to 1% from previous markPx.
 * markPx cannot be updated such that open interest would be 10x the open interest cap.

 * @param oraclePxs - A list (sorted by key) of asset and oracle prices.
 * @param markPxs - An outer list of inner lists (inner list sorted by key) of asset and mark prices.
 * @param externalPerpPxs - A list (sorted by key) of asset and external prices which prevent sudden mark price deviations. 
                            Ideally externally determined by deployer, but could fall back to an EMA of recent mark prices.

See <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/info-endpoint/perpetuals#retrieve-information-about-the-perp-deploy-auction> for how to query for the perp deploy auction status.

## Open interest caps

Builder-deployed perp markets are subject to two types of open interest caps: notional (sum of absolute position size times mark price) and size (sum of absolute position sizes).&#x20;

Notional open interest caps are enforced on the total open interest summed over all assets within the DEX, as well as per-asset. Perp deployers can set a custom open interest cap per asset, which is documented in <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/hip-3-deployer-actions>.

Size-denominated open interest caps are only enforced per-asset. Size-denominated open interest caps are currently a constant 1B per asset, so a reasonable default would be to set `szDecimals` such that the minimal size increment is $1-10 at the initial mark price.
